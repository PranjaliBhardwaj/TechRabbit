# Category Card Edit Feature - Testing Guide

## âœ… Changes Made:

### 1. Added State Management
- âœ… Added `editingCategory` state to track which category is being edited
- âœ… Added `categoryFormData` state for category-specific form data
- âœ… Separate from main form data to avoid conflicts

### 2. Added Edit Handler Functions
- âœ… `handleEditCategory(category)` - Sets up edit mode with current data
- âœ… `handleUpdateCategory(e)` - Handles form submission for updates
- âœ… `cancelCategoryEdit()` - Cancels edit mode and resets form

### 3. Updated Form Component
- âœ… Form now supports both create and edit modes
- âœ… Dynamic form title: "Create New Category Card" vs "Edit Category Card"
- âœ… Dynamic submit button: "Create Category" vs "Update Category"
- âœ… Shows current image filename when editing (if no new image selected)
- âœ… Uses dedicated `categoryFormData` state

### 4. Updated Category Card Display
- âœ… Added "Edit" button next to "Delete" button
- âœ… Edit button triggers `handleEditCategory(card)`
- âœ… Both buttons use `stopPropagation()` to prevent card selection

### 5. Updated Button Handlers
- âœ… "Add Category Card" button now resets `categoryFormData`
- âœ… Form cancellation properly resets all category-related states
